# Live Demo
[https://familycreationsample.herokuapp.com/](https://familycreationsample.herokuapp.com/)

# Main Parts of The Work
1. Migrate the existing Revit WindowWizard Plugin to be used within AppBundle of Design Automation for Revit. Please check [PlugIn](./CreateWindow/PlugIn/) 

2. Create your App, upload the AppBundle, define your Activity and test the workitem with the Postman collection under [Postman Collection](./CreateWindow/PostmanCollection/) 

3. Create the Web App to call the workitem.

# Web App Setup

## Prerequisites

1. **Forge Account**: Learn how to create a Forge Account, activate subscription and create an app at [this tutorial](http://learnforge.autodesk.io/#/account/). 
2. **Visual Code**: Visual Code (Windows or MacOS)
3. **ngrok**: Routing tool, [download here](https://ngrok.com/)
4. **Revit 2019**: required to compile changes into the plugin
5. **Window family template**: A family template that is required while creating window family, you can use this [sample template](./CreateWindow/WindowFamily.rft)
6. **JavaScript ES6** syntax for server-side
7. **JavaScript** basic knowledge with **jQuery**


For using this sample, you need an Autodesk developer credentials. Visit the [Forge Developer Portal](https://developer.autodesk.com), sign up for an account, then [create an app](https://developer.autodesk.com/myapps/create). For this new app, use **http://localhost:3000/api/forge/callback/oauth** as Callback URL, although is not used on 2-legged flow. Finally take note of the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.

## Running locally

Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org), version 8 or newer.

Clone this project or download it (this `nodejs` branch only). It's recommended to install [GitHub desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). To clone it via command line, use the following (**Terminal** on MacOSX/Linux, **Git Shell** on Windows):

    git clone -b nodejs https://github.com/JohnOnSoftware/design.automation-nodejs-revit.window.family.create

To run it, install the required packages, set the enviroment variables with your client ID & secret and finally start it. Via command line, navigate to the folder where this repository was cloned and use the following:

Mac OSX/Linux (Terminal)

    npm install
    export FORGE_CLIENT_ID=<<YOUR CLIENT ID FROM DEVELOPER PORTAL>>
    export FORGE_CLIENT_SECRET=<<YOUR CLIENT SECRET>>
    export FORGE_CALLBACK_URL=<<YOUR CALLBACK URL>>
    export FORGE_WEBHOOK_URL=<<YOUR DESIGN AUTOMATION FOR REVIT CALLBACK URL>>
    export REVIT_IO_NICK_NAME=<<YOUR DESIGN AUTOMATION FOR REVIT NICK NAME>>
    export REVIT_IO_APP_NAME=<<YOUR DESIGN AUTOMATION FOR REVIT APP NAME>>
    export REVIT_IO_ACTIVITY_NAME=<<YOUR DESIGN AUTOMATION FOR REVIT ACTIVITY NAME>>
    npm start

Windows (use **Node.js command line** from Start menu)

    npm install
    set FORGE_CLIENT_ID=<<YOUR CLIENT ID FROM DEVELOPER PORTAL>>
    set FORGE_CLIENT_SECRET=<<YOUR CLIENT SECRET>>
    set FORGE_CALLBACK_URL=<<YOUR CALLBACK URL>>
    set FORGE_WEBHOOK_URL=<<YOUR DESIGN AUTOMATION FOR REVIT CALLBACK URL>>
    set REVIT_IO_NICK_NAME=<<YOUR DESIGN AUTOMATION FOR REVIT NICK NAME>>
    set REVIT_IO_APP_NAME=<<YOUR DESIGN AUTOMATION FOR REVIT APP NAME>>
    set REVIT_IO_ACTIVITY_NAME=<<YOUR DESIGN AUTOMATION FOR REVIT ACTIVITY NAME>>
    npm start

### ngrok
Run `ngrok http 3000` to create a tunnel to your local machine, then copy the address into the `FORGE_WEBHOOK_URL` environment variable. Please check [WebHooks](https://forge.autodesk.com/en/docs/webhooks/v1/tutorials/configuring-your-server/) for details. 

### Start the app
Open the browser: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), the way to create a window family should be straightforwd, just follow the steps:
1. Select window style, either `Double Hung`, `Fixed`, or `Sliding Double`
2. Add a couple of family types, and change the parameters accordingly, set the material for `Glass Pane` and `Sash`, and change the family file name if necessary
3. Select a folder in your BIM360 project, the new created family file will be saved there
4. Click the Create button, and see the result in BIM360
